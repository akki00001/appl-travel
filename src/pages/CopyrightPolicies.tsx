            <h2>For Copyright Claimants:</h2>
            <p>
              In case of any copyright infringement, please send us an email detailing as to which experience/tour is in violation of copyrights and specifically what content on that page violates the copyright. Along with this, it is required that you submit proof of your copyright claim which should include proof which shows you to be the owner of the violating material.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of any reported copyright infringement, the copyright claim including all the related details will be sent to the vendor. Our team will then do a follow up with the vendor on this which may take upto seven business days and may be extended to fourteen days. If the vendor does not reply within this time period, it will be assumed that the claimant’s claim is valid and on the seventh day, the experience/tour will be removed from our website. In case the vendor’s reply is inconclusive and he/she is unable to provide proper proof as to his/her ownership of the material under question, it will be deemed to be a violation of copyright laws and the entire experience/tour including the infringing material will be removed and the vendor will be banned from Thrillophilia. After this, the claimant will be connected with the vendor to take the legal issue forward.
